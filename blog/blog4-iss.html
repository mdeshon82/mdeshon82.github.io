        <h1>Capturing an SSTV Image from the ISS in My Backyard</h1>
        <img src="/img/space-station.jpg" alt="Space Station">
        
        <p>Last night, I had one of those quintessential geeky moments where technology, curiosity, and a bit of luck all came together. Armed with nothing more than my trusty RTL-SDR dongle, a makeshift antenna, and some free software, I set out to capture an SSTV (Slow Scan Television) image from the International Space Station (ISS) as it passed over my backyard.</p>
        
        
        <h2>A Perfect Evening for ISS Spotting</h2>

        <p>The timing couldn't have been better. The passover was at dusk, a magical time when the ISS catches sunlight and glints like a fast-moving star against the deepening blue of the sky. It's always a thrill to spot it, knowing there are humans aboard, orbiting Earth at 17,500 mph.</p>
        
        <p>This particular pass had an added challenge: my neighbor’s house blocked the ISS for a good portion of the trajectory. I knew I wouldn’t get a complete image, but I decided to try anyway. After all, even partial success would be exciting.</p>
        
        <h2>The Gear and Setup</h2>
        <p>Here’s what I used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RTL-SDR dongle:</strong> A budget-friendly software-defined radio that opens up a world of listening possibilities.</li>
            <li><strong>DIY antenna:</strong> My go-to V-dipole rigged for 145.8 MHz, the frequency the ISS transmits SSTV on during special events.</li>
            <li><strong>Software:</strong>SDR# for tuning and MMSSTV for decoding the signal into an image. I connected everything to my laptop, dialed in the frequency, and waited for the pass.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>The Magic of SSTV</h2>
        
        <p>As the ISS rose above the horizon, the faint hiss of static in my headphones began to give way to the characteristic tones of SSTV. It’s a kind of audio magic: those warbling signals transform into colorful, pixelated images.</p>

        <p>The ISS's signal was strong at first, but soon dipped behind my neighbor’s roof. I lost chunks of the transmission, resulting in a blank section across the middle of the image. By the time the ISS reappeared, the signal was weaker as it headed toward the horizon, but I managed to capture enough to see a partial SSTV image.</p>

        <h2>A Memorable Result</h2>

        <p>The image wasn’t perfect—far from it. But the beauty was in the experience: tracking the ISS, marveling at its bright solar panels reflecting the sun, and decoding its transmissions from space right in my backyard.</p>
       
        <p>Even with the interruption, it was thrilling to watch an image slowly materialize on my screen, knowing it was beamed down directly from space. It reminded me that with just a bit of ingenuity, anyone can connect to the vast, incredible world of amateur radio and space exploration.</p>
        
        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>

        <p>I’m already planning for the next ISS SSTV event, this time scouting for a better location with a clearer view of the horizon. If you’ve never tried receiving signals from the ISS or other satellites, I highly recommend giving it a go. With an RTL-SDR, some free software, and a little patience, you can unlock the mysteries of the skies—right from your own backyard.</p>
